             <p>A comparison of the new Class 12 political science textbook titled “Politics in India since Independence” with its older version
                 showed that certain references to Mahatma Gandhi have been deleted The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has removed from the new Class 12 political science and history textbooks references such as the “dislike of Hindu extremists for Mahatma Gandhi’s pursuit of Hindu-Muslim unity” and banning of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) after his assassination. 
                The Indian Express was the first to report the deletions from the revised textbooks published for the academic year 2023-24.</p>

                    <p>In the Class 12 History textbook titled “Themes in Indian History-3”, a paragraph has been 
                        revised in the chapter “Mahatma Gandhi and the Nationalist Movement.” The revised paragraph reads, “At his daily prayer meeting on the evening of 30 January, Gandhiji was shot dead by a young man. The assassin, who surrendered afterwards, was Nathuram Godse.” Earlier, it read: “Gandhiji was shot dead by a young man. The assassin, who surrendered afterwards, was a Brahmin from Pune named Nathuram Godse, the editor of an extremist Hindu newspaper who had denounced Gandhiji as an appeaser of Muslims.” Despite several attempts, NCERT director Dinesh Prasad Saklani was unavailable for comments. In June last year, the NCERT rationalised the syllabi of Classes 6 to 12 to reduce the burden on students. Among the changes made was the removal of all references to the 2002 Gujarat riots, 
                        Cold War, and Mughal courts, industrial revolution. Some Dalit writers were also dropped from a Class 7 textbook.</p>
